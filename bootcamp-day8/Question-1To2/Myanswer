1. Java Collections Framework (JCF)

The Java Collections Framework is a unified architecture that provides a set of interfaces and
classes for storing and manipulating groups of objects efficiently. It includes core interfaces
like List, Set, Map, and their implementations such as ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, and HashMap.


Advantages:

Provides ready-to-use data structures and algorithms.

Ensures reusability and consistency across different collection types.

Offers dynamic resizing (unlike arrays).

Simplifies data manipulation like searching, sorting, and iteration.

Improves code quality and performance through optimized, well-tested classes.



2. Differences between Vector, ArrayList, LinkedList, and HashSet

Vector: A legacy class that is synchronized (thread-safe) but slower. It grows its size by
100% when full.

ArrayList: A resizable array-based list that is faster than Vector but not synchronized.
 It provides quick access (O(1)) but slower insertions/deletions in the middle.

LinkedList: Uses a doubly linked list internally. It’s efficient for insertions and
deletions (O(1)) but slower for random access (O(n)).

HashSet: Implements the Set interface using a hash table. It stores unique elements only,
 doesn’t maintain order, and offers average O(1) performance for add, remove, and search operations.
